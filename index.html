somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me
i ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an l on her forehead
well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the backstreet?
you'll never know if you don't go.
you'll never shine if you don't glow.
hey now you're an all star
get your game on go play
hey now you're a rock star
get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
